"""
Overriding methods is really useful in some cases
but sometimes we want to add some extra logic to the existing method.
In order to do that we need a way to call the method from the parent class.
Python gives us a way to do that using super().

super() gives us a proxy object.
With this proxy object, we can invoke the method of an objectâ€™s parent class
(also called its superclass).
We call the required function as a method on super():
