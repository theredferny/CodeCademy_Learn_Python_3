"""Methods are functions that are defined as part of a class.
The first argument in a method is always the object that is calling the method.
Convention recommends that we name this first argument self.
Methods always have at least this one argument.
We define methods similarly to functions, except that they are indented to be part of the class.

When you call a method it automatically passes the object calling the method as the first argument."""
