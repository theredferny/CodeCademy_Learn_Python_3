# In range, the first argument is the starting point of the list,
# the second is one number greater than the last element of the list (if a list has 15 as argument, it will stop before 15),
# the third argument is how many numbers will be skipped between the elements of the list (for instance: 1, 4, 7)
list1 = range(5, 15, 3)

list2 = range(0, 40, 5)
