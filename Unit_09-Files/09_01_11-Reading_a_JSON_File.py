CSV isn’t the only file format that Python has a built-in library for. We can also use Python’s file tools to read and write JSON. JSON, an abbreviation of JavaScript Object Notation, is a file format inspired by the programming language JavaScript. The name, like CSV is a bit of a misnomer — some JSON is not valid JavaScript (and plenty of JavaScript is not valid JSON).

JSON’s format is endearingly similar to Python dictionary syntax, and so JSON files might be easy to read from a Python developer standpoint. Nonetheless, Python comes with a json package that will help us parse JSON files into actual Python dictionaries. Suppose we have a JSON file like the following:

purchase_14781239.json

{
  'user': 'ellen_greg',
  'action': 'purchase',
  'item_id': '14781239',
}

We would be able to read that in as a Python dictionary with the following code:

json_reader.py

import json
 
with open('purchase_14781239.json') as purchase_json:
  purchase_data = json.load(purchase_json)
 
print(purchase_data['user'])
# Prints 'ellen_greg'

First we import the json package. We opened the file using our trusty open() command. Since we’re opening it in 
read-mode we just need to pass the file name. We save the file in the temporary variable purchase_json. 

We continue by parsing purchase_json using json.load(), 
creating a Python dictionary out of the file. 
Saving the results into purchase_data means we can interact with it. 
We print out one of the values of the JSON file by keying into the 
purchase_data object."""
